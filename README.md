# ComputerGraphics
Repository to store Lab Works of Computer Graphics subject.

## List of labs
1. Simple 2D editor, that provides drawing simple shapes with chosen colors. This project is created
using Qt framework. This lab must have realization of logical color mixing, but I have not found analog of LogicalOP
functions in 3.3+ version of OpenGL. As I understood, in 3.3+ all color operations provided by shaders and written in 
Shader language (may be in external files or added as string in main OpenGL code).
So this part of task is not done.
2. This is just simple 3D object made of 3D primitives in "clear" OpenGL.
3. ???
